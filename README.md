# Personal Tokens

A repository of tools and goals towards the kinds of personal tokens that I'd like to see.

[A blog post I've written on personal currencies](https://medium.com/capabul/its-all-subjective-valuation-577fb5ad067f).

Some basic things I'd like to do:

- Mint either far more tokens than I need, or mint them freely.
- Establish trading pairs of my token on uniswap or other exchanges, so that holders of my token have a way of "cashing out" if they want to at any time.
- Give them out to close friends who I'd like to offer support to.
- Provide an easy path for recipients to use or redeem the tokens without much prior knowledge.
- Develop infrastructure that allows pairs of people to establish trading pairs between their tokens, so their holders can have access to each others' liquidity and services. (This is a bit like [Circles](https://joincircles.net/) on a bonding curve).
- Develop tools for allowing easy multi-hop personal token exchange, so that larger and larger networks of people with personal tokens can access each others' liquidity and services.
- Create simple tools that allow people to easily deploy their own personal tokens.
- Create tools that allow people to generically offer common services for their tokens (scheduling, payments, inventory, rentals, etc).
